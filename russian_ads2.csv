In the 1730s, a seven-year-old English girl was washed                                          up on the shores of West Africa and was adopted by her rescuers. She                                          became the wife of a Prince and started a dynasty that extends into many of                                          today's Xhosa royal families. Due to her recessive gene, now and then a child                                          is born in the area with bright blue eyes. This is fascinating! This is a pure luck                                          for a Black girl to be adopted and loved after being thrown to the sea.

It                                   is well-known how libtards are eager to blame our forefathers for being racist.                                   Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all                                   these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union.

Closeted minor leaguer for St Louis Cardinals quit after coach and players                                          spoke of killing gay people                                          Tyler Dunnington was a 28th-round pick by the St Louis Cardinals in the 2014                                           Major League Baseball draft and given a chance to pursue his dream of being                                          in the big leagues. But after just one season pitching for a Cardinals minor                                          league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during                                           his playing days, he was a closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable                                          environment.

This is absolutely insane in the                                           highest order.

"173"," 897                             "," Robert Bentley, Alabama Governor, has decided to reform prison system.                                          This is actually good news? Alabama happens to be one of the nation's                                           poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison. The prison system                                          houses 24,000 inmates but it was designed for 13,000.Let me enlighten you a                                          little on how it's going to be done. Four other larger prisons will be built                                          additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have                                          taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he                                          chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind                                           bars. It shows how much he cares for his people.

Carter said he                                          was at a station waiting for bus. Freeing himself from emotional trauma,                                          Carter decided to hip his soul with music, when he put his headphones on                                          and started to dance. Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking                                           him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or                                          violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them.                                          Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American                                           police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks.

Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen                                          named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to                                          assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in                                           Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by                                          authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children                                          stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the                                          children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers — ages of 5, 9,                                          and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old                                           boy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a                                          fined of $15, 863.

You can be put                                           behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life                                           becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making                                          a better living.

This is absolutely insane in the                                           highest order. He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a                                          video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire                                          and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he                                          commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately                                          ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position                                          when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him                                          and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is                                          there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

"208"," 537                       "," The liberal mass media tried to overblow a story about the KKK's                                    endorsement of Trump. They claimed Donald is supported by David Duke and                                    ""white supremacists"". The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist                                    and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared ""I don't know                                    anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed                                    to be talking people I know nothing about.""                                    However, ""for some reasons"" the same mass media in their revelation                                    campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former                                    KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of ""surpassing eloquence and                                    nobility"". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying ""It is                                    almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd.                                    He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its                                    historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he                                    was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless                                    advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the                                    Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a                                    government that improves the lives of the people it serves.""                                    So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate                                    can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show                                    her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that.

Some of them have spent                                           more than half a year awaiting a trial, but the city failed to provide the legal                                           help to them. Each year the budget is shredding, but the Louisiana remains                                          the state with the highest incarceration rate.

Clark                                          from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was                                          too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest.                                          On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting                                          that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas,                                          was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his                                          son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he                                           hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken                                          to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his                                          combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some                                           breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour                                          later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital.                                          An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail                                          inmate.                                           Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were                                          followed.                                          We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after ""fighting"" with                                          the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at                                           hospital.

In some state, the numbers are even more disturbing. For example,                                          Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3                                           percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and                                           Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be                                          suspended from school.                                          The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline                                          exists.                                          Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate                                          among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education                                          is only their privilege.

She was shot by the                                    cop while she slept on a couch during a botched raid. The killer is still                                    employed by the Detroit Police Department. He was charged with involuntary                                    manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped                                    in January 2015.                                    Justice hasn't been served for Aiyana and her grieving family.                                    We're planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal                                    Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police                                    violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much                                    attention as possible to the lack of justice for the families of those who lost                                    their beloved ones at the hands of the police.

Bob Miranda-Boulay said `I don't count' — that                                          is what our veterans feel. That is not an attitude they deserve.                                          ""I wanted to make a difference,"" Boulay said. ""I love my country and I wanted                                          to do the right thing. I wanted to be a Marine."" That is a real shame our                                          veterans feel being betrayed by our country leaders.

"512"," 862                             "," The Civil Rights Movement was fighting for the real equality in general and                                           particularly the equal rights of voting. It started in North Carolina but it can                                          spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights.                                          The U.S. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits                                          challenging changes to the state's election laws, declaring that the                                          challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their                                          voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same                                          —day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to                                          the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver's                                          license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world                                          take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.

The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the                                          whole community.

According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about                                    the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building.

The video shows how officers, Michelle Morsi-Murphy and Jose Lopez,                                    brutalized Rev. Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when Morsi-                                    Murphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and                                    demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license;                                    Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor                                    Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only                                    victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too.                                    The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why                                    the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held                                    personally and financially responsible for their actions.

So why do we have another                                    attitude to people in blue?

"633"," 1492                       "," SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.                                    Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she                                    realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face                                    is priceless.                                    The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for                                    illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who                                    had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The                                    driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under                                    threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125.                                    The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11                                    years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that                                    how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix                                    the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer                                    is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not                                    have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon.                                    To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun.                                    Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give                                    our citizens a chance to get back home alive.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of                                    his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the                                    ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the                                    location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on                                    the passenger's side.                                    When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the                                    situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man                                    briefly lying unconscious on the ground.                                    The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows                                    that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?                                    Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO                                    POLICE!

Well, I guess it's time to answer the question...                                    As the nation has been torn apart by police violence and abuse, we have                                    begun to wonder whether there are any good cops at all. Do they exist?                                    Where are these legendary ""good cops""? Sad, but according to our research                                    good cops are threatened with extinction.

Cops are programmed to                                    take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are                                    judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,                                    it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot                                    someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their                                    eyes.

In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand                                    that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,                                    they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

Patriots carried and waved American flags, while the                                          Clinton/Sanders supporters carried MEXICAN flags and attempted to confront                                          a very diverse group of Donald Trump supporters. That explains why the                                          Democrats encourage the illegal immigration. They are ready to destroy                                          America just to be elected.                                          We have to defend this nation! Let's organize rallies against the illegal                                          immigration around the whole country!

"840"," 852                             "," All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secret                                          gay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even                                          if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or                                          just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But                                          if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your                                          secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other                                          cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the                                           misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally                                          withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper                                          administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly                                          enough,""Sworn officer of the court"" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is                                          even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code                                          of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill,                                          which aimed to ""modernize"" two references to ""Orientals"" and ""Negros"" in                                          the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with ""Asian                                          Americans"" and ""African Americans,"" respectively. ""The term `Oriental' has                                          no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be                                          gone for good,"" Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill                                          shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become                                          the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.

"877"," 1479                       "," Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, and                                    killing innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common                                    that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were                                    wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,                                    karma's coming back for blue pigs!                                    A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police                                    officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two                                    officers for seemingly no reason.                                    The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two                                    school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza                                    shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of                                    police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally                                    nothing without using their guns.                                    Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their                                    own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and                                    electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and                                    more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my                                    rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.                                    Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine                                    about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is                                    why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our                                    ancestors did it for centuries.                                    Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of                                    his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the                                    ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the                                    location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on                                    the passenger's side.                                    When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the                                    situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man                                    briefly lying unconscious on the ground.                                    The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows                                    that he had no alcohol in his system.

After she screamed from the pain for                                    several seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck                                    and searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in                                    handcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg                                    before she could go home.

In popular                                    culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came                                    to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things                                    unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed.

Over                                    the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth,                                    eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5                                    million in cash, according to a press release. ""It would be safe to say that the                                    money would be taken back to Mexico, and that's where the source of the                                    cocaine was,"" special agent Tim Stone said.                                    This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which                                    makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to                                    prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The                                    most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as                                    unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as                                    they can.                                    At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government                                    officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get                                    filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation.                                    Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only                                    hope for a better future!

It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton                                          Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights,                                           Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of chaos and                                          carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The                                          sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war.                                          As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to ""kill white people"".                                          There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no                                           proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago                                          and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah                                          X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us                                          time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers».                                          The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is                                          a violent anti-government riot!

These videos and instances have become so common                                    that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were                                    wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now,                                    karma's coming back for blue pigs!                                    A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police                                    officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two                                    officers for seemingly no reason.                                    The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two                                    school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza                                    shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of                                    police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally                                    nothing without using their guns.                                    Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their                                    own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and                                    electrical ways, rape or even kill you ""doing their job."" All those things and                                    more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my                                    rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America.                                    Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine                                    about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is                                    why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our                                    ancestors did it for centuries.                                    Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change.

Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of                                    his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the                                    ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the                                    location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on                                    the passenger's side.                                    When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the                                    situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man                                    briefly lying unconscious on the ground.                                    The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows                                    that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys?                                    Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO                                    POLICE!

Another arrest was carried                                          out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were                                          arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July                                          7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have                                           been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police                                          officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are                                           blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the                                           protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors                                          are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there.

That's a fact that US police officers are bad trained. Cops are programmed to                                    take innocent lives. Cops here in America play God. They believe they are                                    judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law,                                    it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot                                    someone who is not a threat simply because that person ""deserves it"" in their                                    eyes.                                    It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the                                    difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will                                    get away with it.                                    In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand                                    that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you,                                    they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job.

The day when everyone must stand up for their rights in the                                    city where ""We can't breath"" movement was created after Eric Garner's death.                                    Mr. Garner and his family paid a horrible price to make us all realize that                                    we're in danger. Eric will never be forgotten. The crimes of police officers will                                    never be forgotten as well. Police brutality in this country is unacceptable and                                    must be stopped!                                    Join us, show your support and solidarity. On October 22 we will meet at the                                    place where Mr. Garner was killed.                                    202 Bay Street, Staten Island, New York, 2 pm.

It is                                          unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For                                          centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but                                          they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does                                          not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it                                          mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some                                          outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a                                          victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.                                          We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on                                          the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and                                          gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but                                          not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher                                          taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist                                          attacks. Banned guns.

However, most of these                                          athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10,                                          after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the                                          Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day,                                          the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive                                           board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season                                          and canceled the whole football season.

"1276"," 2790                             "," HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANS                                          The last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was                                          in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life                                          improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are                                          some real Clinton decisions:                                          —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had                                           been exaggerated by Republicans.                                          —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007                                          supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'                                           medical care.                                          -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20                                           million for veterans' health care facilities.                                          -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion                                          for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""                                          In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the                                           poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the                                          issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they                                          need so bad!                                           Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a                                          direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one                                          raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!

A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33,                                    of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October                                    12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to                                    drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire                                    themselves.                                    This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is                                    too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be                                    destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the                                    President of the United States.                                    Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of                                    every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American                                    national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments                                    liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country.                                    Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist                                    movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse                                    racism, against those who want to destroy America!

Their idea was simple - we can't just talk to make the change, we must take                                    action. They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge                                    police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the                                    government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party                                    ""the greatest threat to the internal security of the country"". They tried to close                                    it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was                                    dissolved.                                    50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country                                    stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country                                    like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We                                    need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that                                    can make Black Lives really matter.                                    Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has                                    made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants.

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and                                    charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief.                                    It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards                                    Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale.                                    Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda                                    influences even on Southern people.                                    The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be                                    blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American                                    history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect.                                    It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect                                    our history and fight against liberal brainwashing.

And here are                                    some real Clinton decisions:                                    —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had                                    been exaggerated by Republicans.                                    —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007                                    supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans'                                    medical care.                                    -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20                                    million for veterans' health care facilities.                                    -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion                                    for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.""                                    In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the                                    poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the                                    issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they                                    need so bad!                                    Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a                                    direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one                                    raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her!

It is                                          unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For                                          centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but                                          they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does                                          not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it                                          mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some                                          outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a                                          victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.                                          We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on                                          the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and                                          gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but                                          not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher                                          taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist                                          attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them                                          what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

"1504"," 726                            "," Fellow Texans! It's time to say a strong NO to the establishment robbers. It is                                          unacceptable for us to see them ruin all we've been building for decades. For                                          centuries. The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but                                          they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does                                          not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it                                          mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some                                          outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a                                          victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no.                                          We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on                                          the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and                                          gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but                                          not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher                                          taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist                                          attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them                                          what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE!

According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in self-                                    defense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times,                                    hitting Scott five times from behind.                                    Slager's defense attorney's:                                    ""The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically                                    motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather                                    their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a split-                                    second life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable                                    armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.'                                    The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken                                    brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's                                    dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him                                    about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott                                    jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a                                    bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire.                                    We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead                                    black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none                                    of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to                                    other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay.

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were                                    warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley,                                    who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars.

Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to                                    balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, ""It's Up to Us,"" she                                    was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because                                    ignoring it can take away years of people's lives.

Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods                                    because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of                                    home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most.                                    The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it                                    cant be torn down!                                    I'm so proud of this man!

Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two                                    college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal                                    profession and went to law school right after his parole.                                    He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after                                    waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards,                                    Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented                                    various inmates and prison guards in civil cases.

As a teenager,                                    Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles.                                    By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later                                    apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught                                    carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for                                    cooking, while he was on kitchen duty.                                    He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some                                    of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing                                    many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land                                    a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started                                    getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All                                    the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has                                    continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can                                    achieve in life with the right choices.
